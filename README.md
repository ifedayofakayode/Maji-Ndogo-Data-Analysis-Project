# Maji-Ndogo-Data-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases a data-driven analysis of the water crisis in Maji Ndogo using SQL queries within a Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to uncover data inconsistencies, expose corruption, and provide actionable insights to improve water access and quality.

## Files Included
- **Maji Ndogo part II.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook with SQL code demonstrating data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.


## Skills Demonstrated
- Complex SQL querying and joining multiple tables to uncover data patterns.
- Data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy.
- Fact-checking and corruption detection using cross-referencing audit data.
- Interpretation of real-world data for social impact.
- Documentation and presentation of findings using Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) to review the SQL queries and analysis steps.
2. You can run the notebook yourself by connecting it to your SQL database or adapt the queries for your own datasets.

## Impact
This project highlights how technical SQL skills can be used ethically to uncover data truths and directly impact communities by enabling better resource allocation. Here 
are some of the insights uncovered from this analysis.

Insights
1. Most water sources are rural.
2. 43% of our people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
3. 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes, but within that group, 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes,
pumps, and reservoirs.
4. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean..
5. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes.
6. In terms of queues:
- Queues are very long on Saturdays.
- Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
- Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues.

Recommedations

- Most people will benefit if we improve the shared taps first.
- Wells are a good source of water, but many are contaminated. Fixing this will benefit a lot of people.
- Fixing existing infrastructure will help many people. If they have running water again, they won't have to queue, thereby shorting queue times for
others. So we can solve two problems at once.
- Installing taps in homes will stretch our resources too thin, so for now, if the queue times are low, we won't improve that source.
- Most water sources are in rural areas. We need to ensure our teams know this as this means they will have to make these repairs/upgrades in
rural areas where road conditions, supplies, and labour are harder challenges to overcome.
